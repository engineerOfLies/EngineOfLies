Make a hide/unhide dialog window

Make a utility dialog that is spawned as a child window and given a pointer
to its parent window.  The hide/unhide window will remain hidden and sleeping
intil its parent window is hidden, at which point it will be drawn and wake up.
it contains only a single button to unhide the window.  It should take as an
option the window def file path.  So individual programs and windows can 
define their own.
